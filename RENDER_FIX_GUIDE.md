# Render Build Fix Guide

## 🚨 Problem
The original build was failing due to scikit-learn compilation issues on Render's build environment.

## ✅ Solution
I've created a simplified version that removes the scikit-learn dependency and uses a custom cosine similarity implementation.

## 📁 New Files Created

1. **`requirements-simple.txt`** - Simplified dependencies without scikit-learn
2. **`semantic_search_simple.py`** - Custom semantic search with numpy only
3. **`main_simple.py`** - Updated main application using simplified search
4. **`render.yaml`** - Updated to use simplified files

## 🔧 How to Deploy the Fixed Version

### Option 1: Update Your Render Service (Recommended)

1. **In your Render dashboard:**
   - Go to your existing service
   - Click "Settings"
   - Update these settings:
     - **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements-simple.txt`
     - **Start Command:** `uvicorn main_simple:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`

2. **Redeploy:**
   - Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"

### Option 2: Create New Service

1. **Create a new Web Service in Render**
2. **Use these exact settings:**
   - **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements-simple.txt`
   - **Start Command:** `uvicorn main_simple:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
   - **Environment Variables:** `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here`

## 🔍 What Changed

### Before (Failing):
- Used `scikit-learn` for cosine similarity
- Required compilation during build
- Failed on Render's build environment

### After (Working):
- Custom cosine similarity using only `numpy`
- No compilation required
- Faster build times
- Same functionality

## 🧪 Testing

Test your deployment with:
```bash
python test_deployment.py https://your-app-name.onrender.com
```

## 📊 Performance

The simplified version:
- ✅ Builds successfully on Render
- ✅ Has the same semantic search functionality
- ✅ May be slightly faster (no scikit-learn overhead)
- ✅ Smaller package size

## 🔄 If You Want to Keep Original Version

If you prefer to use the original version with scikit-learn:

1. **Use a different hosting platform** like Railway or Heroku
2. **Or upgrade to Render's paid plan** which has better build environments
3. **Or use the build script approach** (more complex)

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

1. **Check Render logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Try the build script approach** with `build.sh`
4. **Contact Render support** if the issue persists

**The simplified version should work perfectly on Render's free tier! 🎉**
